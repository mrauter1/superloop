# Test Audit Criteria
Check these boxes (`- [x]`) only when true.

- [ ] **Coverage Quality**: New or changed behavior is covered at the appropriate level, and preserved behavior is covered where regression risk is material.
- [ ] **Regression Protection**: Tests would catch likely regression bugs, logical flaws, and unintended behavior in changed or adjacent behavior.
- [ ] **Edge Cases / Failure Paths**: Relevant boundary cases, error cases, and failure paths are covered.
- [ ] **Reliability**: Tests avoid flaky assumptions and use stable setup, timing, ordering, and environment expectations.
- [ ] **Behavioral Intent**: Tests do not encode a regression, reduced behavior, or compatibility break unless that change is explicitly required by user intent and explicitly confirmed.
